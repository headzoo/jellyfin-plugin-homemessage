# Jellyfin.Plugin.HomeMessage

Adds admin-configurable messages to the Jellyfin home page, with scheduling and
per-user dismiss tracking.

## Before you start

The plugin needs file permissions to modify the home page. When running Jellyfin
from Docker, be sure the container user has the correct permissions.
